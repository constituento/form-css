# form-css
This is a collection of CSS files that customize Wufoo forms to match the style of our mobile apps.
### Creating a new stylesheet
1. [Wufoo offers this style documentation.](https://www.wufoo.com/guides/use-form-anatomy-custom-css/)
2. GitHub isn't ideal for serving raw CSS, so create a production URL with [RawGit](https://rawgit.com).
3. Open a theme in Wufoo's Theme Designer, click "Advanced," and paste the RawGit link into the text field.
